                I am a student at the Florida State University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. 
                I aspire to work mostly in back-end development using languages such as C++, Python and Java. 
                When I am not coding, you can probably find me watching Brooklyn 99, playing sports such as 
                basketball or softball, auditioning to be the next Disney star and/or eating pizza. 
                I am originally from Miami, Florida and moved to Jacksonville, Florida in the 6th grade.
